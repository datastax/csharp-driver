# C# Driver usage samples

This folder contains examples on how to use some features of the C# Driver for [Apache Cassandra][cassandra] and DataStax Enterprise.

You should also visit the [Documentation][doc-index] and [FAQ][faq].

## Code samples

- Concurrent execution
  - [Inserts multiple rows in a table limiting the amount of parallel requests](ConcurrentExecutions/ExecuteInLoop/Program.cs)
- DataStax Astra
  - [Getting started with DataStax Astra and the Secure Connection Bundle](SecureConnectionBundle/MinimalExample/Program.cs)
- TLS/SSL
  - Server Auth
    - [Loading a root certificate in code](Ssl/SslServerAuthOnly/LoadingCertificateManuallyExample.cs)
    - [Using a trusted root certificate or a certificate from the certificate store](Ssl/SslServerAuthOnly/WindowsCertificateStoreExample.cs)
  - Client and Server Auth
    - [Loading a root certificate and client certificates in code](Ssl/SslTwoWayAuth/LoadingCertificateManuallyExample.cs)
    - [Using certificates from the certificate store](Ssl/SslTwoWayAuth/WindowsCertificateStoreExample.cs)
- Metrics
  - [Graphite and Grafana integration with App.Metrics](Metrics/AppMetricsGraphite/Program.cs)

Each example is generally structured in a way where the `Cluster` and `Session` are connected at the beginning and shutdown/disposed at the end.
While this is suitable for example console applications, you should reuse the `Session` and `Cluster` instances and only call `cluster.ShutdownAsync()` / `cluster.Dispose()` when exiting your application.

If you have any questions regarding these examples, feel free to post your questions in the [mailing list][mailing-list].
