# CqlPoco - an object mapper (micro-ORM) for Cassandra
CqlPoco is a lightweight object mapper (micro-ORM) for Apache Cassandra.  You write queries with [CQL](http://www.datastax.com/documentation/cql/3.1/cql/cql_intro_c.html), and CqlPoco will take care of mapping rows returned from Cassandra to your classes.  It was inspired by [PetaPoco](https://github.com/toptensoftware/PetaPoco), [NPoco](https://github.com/schotime/NPoco), [Dapper.NET](https://github.com/StackExchange/dapper-dot-net) and the [cqlengine](https://github.com/cqlengine/cqlengine) project.

### A simple query
```csharp
public class User
{
    public Guid UserId { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

// Get a list of users from Cassandra
List<User> users = client.Fetch<User>("SELECT userid, name FROM users");
```
This works by mapping the column names in your CQL statement to the property names on the `User` class (using a case-insensitive match).  Simple scenarios like this are possible without doing any mapping configuration.

### Configuring CqlPoco
CqlPoco uses the [DataStax .NET driver](https://github.com/datastax/csharp-driver) for Apache Cassandra to execute queries.  When you install CqlPoco via the NuGet package, the driver will be installed as well.  As such, you'll want to start by getting an `ISession` instance from the driver using the Cluster builder.

```csharp
// Use the Cluster builder to connect to your Cassandra cluster
Cluster cluster = Cluster.Builder().AddContactPoint("127.0.0.1").Build();
ISession session = cluster.Connect("mykeyspace");
```
Once you've got your `ISession` instance, you can configure CqlPoco pretty easily.
```csharp
ICqlClient client = CqlClientConfiguration.ForSession(session).BuildCqlClient();
```
This `ICqlClient` instance is thread-safe and you'll want to take it and reuse it everywhere (maybe, for example, by registering it as a Singleton in your IoC container of choice).

### Defining mappings
In many scenarios, you'll need more control over how your class is mapped to Cassandra.  You have two options for telling CqlPoco how to map your classes: decorate your classes with attributes or define mappings in code using the fluent interface.

##### Attribute Example
```csharp
[TableName("users")]
[PrimaryKey("userid")]
public class User
{
    [Column("userid")]
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```
##### Fluent Interface Example
```csharp
public class MyMappings : Mappings
{
    public MyMappings()
    {
        // Just define mappings in the constructor of your class that inherits from Mappings
        For<User>().TableName("users")
                   .PrimaryKey("userid")
                   .Column(u => u.Id, cm => cm.WithName("userid"));
    }
}
```
If you decide to go the fluent interface route, you can tell CqlPoco about your mappings when you configure it.  For example:
```csharp
ICqlClient client = CqlClientConfiguration.ForSession(session)
                                          .UseMappings<MyMappings>()
                                          .BuildCqlClient();
```

### Some other API examples
The simple query example is great, but CqlPoco's `ICqlClient` has a lot of other methods for doing things like Inserts, Updates, Deletes, selecting a single record and more.  And all methods come with their `async` counterparts.  Here's a quick sampling.

```csharp
// All query methods (Fetch, Single, First, etc.) will auto generate the SELECT and FROM
// clauses if not specified
List<User> users = client.Fetch<User>();
List<User> users = client.Fetch<User>("FROM users WHERE name = ?", someName);
List<User> users = client.Fetch<User>("WHERE name = ?", someName);

// Single and SingleOrDefault for getting a single record
var user = client.Single<User>("WHERE userid = ?", userId);
var user = client.SingleOrDefault<User>("WHERE userid = ?", userId);

// First and FirstOrDefault for getting first record
var user = client.First<User>("SELECT * FROM users");
var user = client.FirstOrDefault<User>("SELECT * FROM users");

// All query methods also support "flattening" to just the column's value type when
// selecting a single column
Guid userId = client.First<Guid>("SELECT userid FROM users");
List<string> names = client.Fetch<string>("SELECT name FROM users");

// Insert a POCO
var newUser = new User { UserId = Guid.NewGuid(), Name = "SomeNewUser" };
client.Insert(newUser);

// Update with POCO
someUser.Name = "A new name!";
client.Update(someUser);

// Update with CQL (will prepend table name to CQL)
client.Update<User>("SET name = ? WHERE userid = ?", someNewName, userId);

// Delete with POCO
client.Delete(someUser);

// Delete with CQL (will prepend table name to CQL)
client.Delete<User>("WHERE userid = ?", userId);
```
