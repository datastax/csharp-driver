    ///     yaml file. In most case, this is the correct address to use by the driver and that is

    ///     mechanism will either not be reachable directly by the driver or should not be the
    ///     preferred address to use to reach the node (for instance, the rpc_address set on
    ///     Cassandra nodes might be a private IP, but some clients may have to use a public IP,
    ///     or pass by a router to reach that node). This interface allows to deal with such cases,
    ///     by allowing to translate an address as sent by a Cassandra node to another address
    ///     to be used by the driver for connection.
    ///     Please note that the contact points addresses provided while creating the
    ///     <c>Cluster</c> instance are not "translated", only IP address retrieve from or sent
    ///     by Cassandra nodes to the driver are.
